      I attended Analy Highschool in Sebastopol. At the time I hated school with a passion, but there were a couple amazing teachers there who made it suck less. Shout out to Ms.Williamson who spent almost every single one of her weekends dealing with debate practice and getting students back and forth to tournaments. Much like a bad acid trip, many hours of debate can seriously alter how your brain interprets the world around you. My life was forever changed. In addition to debate I also spent a huge amount of time in the Analy theater, which was an interesting experiance. From this I somehow got a master key to get into the building, since me and the other lighting guys had to show up at all hours. They had no idea how much mischef my friends and I got into because of that key. Although I hated going to school at the time, I made a bunch of friends who I still keep in contact with, and met a bunch of cute girls that I do not. At the end of my time there I had some run ins with the administation that left a bad taste in my mouth (I contend that I was specifically targeted because one of the vice principles had a personal problem with me, Im sure her story would differ. Years later I saw her smoking a joint outside of a show and realized that what was an epic struggle in my mind was probably a minor blip for her that she doesnt even remember), and after leaving the school in 2007 it took me a while to find my way back into a classroom.
