            After working at Redwood Hill Farms, I decided it was time for a major change in my life, and I enrolled in classes at the SRJC. At the time I was sure I wanted to get a degree in Mechanical Engineering. Even though I ended up changing my mind after a year of classes, it was still a very good experiance for me to go into something that I <em>thought</em> I was into, only to find that actually I hated it. As one of my professors told me, fail early fail often! Nothing is worse then investing years of your life into something only to find after all that time that you really cant stand it. After that first rocky year, I realized that I had been doing terribly in my material science class because I had spent 100 hours working on the tick-tack-toe game for my MATLAB course. One was a major requirement that I hated, the other an elective I couldnt get enough of. Time to re-evaluate! Next semester I enrolled in all computer science classes and haven't looked back since!

The format was interesting, each team was given the same set of parts, and then over the semester we had several competitions where the robots would be scored on a variety of metrics. The rest of the class did all their programming in the GUI app given to us, I figured out how to write it all in C and kicked all their asses. It was glorious.</td></tr>

                  <tr><td>CS 17.11 Java Programming</td><td>C</td><td>This was not so much a java class as and Android class, as the professor was a full time Android developer for Western Mutual who taught in the evenings. </td></tr>
                  <tr><td>PHYS 42 Electicity and Magetism</td><td>C</td><td>The professor for this class was extremely disorganized and changed the assignment requirements daily. Dispite that I was able to enjoy the course, and built a fun little project for the final assignment. I embeded a <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardLilyPad">LilyPad Arduino</a> in a gardening glove and hooked it up to a linear magetometer and vibration motor. The end result was that you could wear the glove  wave your hand through space and feel the strength of magetic fields.</td></tr>

                  <tr><td>PHIL 3 Critical Thinking</td><td>A</td><td>A fun class. The professor was a super duper left wing hippie, but she backed all her opinions up with real arguments and not just bullshit talking points.</td></tr>
                  <tr><td>CS 81.21 Intro to Unix</td><td>F</td><td>Although I filed the paperwork to drop this class the second week of the semester, it looks like the professor never took me off his grade book.</td></tr>
                  <tr><td>PSYCH 1a General Psychology</td><td>B</td><td>I look back on this class fondly. Sitting two rows to my right was this incredably cute girl wearing a Greatful Dead shirt. One day I walked into the campus cafe before class to get a coffee and she was sitting in a booth reading and eating carrots. For the rest of the semester, I would go to the cafe everyday, just in the hopes of running into her. After the second or third time seeing her there I finaly was able to come up with the courage to ask her a question about the homework, pretending that I had forgotten what was due that day (the finished assignment was sitting in my backpack). The rest, as they say, is history.</td></tr>
