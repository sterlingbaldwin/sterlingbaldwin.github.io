just like they drive here. The second rule I learned is that if you want to catch the bus, you need to stand right up against the sidewalk. I was standing all of 2 feed back
from the edge, directly under the bus stop sign, but the driver just blew right past without a second thought. Its these little things that no on bothers to tell you, since obviously
everyone knows the rules already so why bother saying anything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
