      I attended Analy Highschool in Sebastopol. At the time I hated school with a passion, but there were a couple amazing teachers there who made it suck less. Shout out to Ms.Williamson who spent almost every single one of her weekends dealing with debate practice and getting students back and forth to tournaments. Much like a bad acid trip, many hours of debate can seriously alter how your brain interprets the world around you. My life was forever changed. In addition to debate I also spent a huge amount of time in the Analy theater, which was an interesting experiance. From this I somehow got a master key to get into the building, since me and the other lighting guys had to show up at all hours. They had no idea how much mischef my friends and I got into because of that key. Although I hated going to school at the time, I made a bunch of friends who I still keep in contact with, and met a bunch of cute girls that I do not. At the end of my time there I had some run ins with the administation that left a bad taste in my mouth (I content that I was specifically targeted because one of the vice principles had a personal issue with me, Im sure her story would differ. Years later I saw her smoking a joint outside of a show and realized that what was an epic struggle in my mind was probably a minor blip for her that she doesnt even remember), and after leaving the school in 2007 it took me a while to find my way back into a classroom.

      After working at Redwood Hill Farms, I decided it was time for a major change in my life, and I enrolled in classes at the SRJC. At the time I was sure I wanted to get a degree in Mechanical Engineering. Even though I ended up changing my mind after a year of classes, it was still a very good experiance for me to go into something that I <em>thought</em> I was into, only to find that actually I hated it. As one of my professors told me, fail early fail often! Nothing is worse then investing years of your life into something only to find after all that time that you really cant stand it. After that first rocky year, I realized that I had been doing terribly in my material science class because I had spent 100 hours working on the tick-tack-toe game for my MATLAB course. One was a major requirement that I hated, the other an elective I couldnt get enough of. Time to re-evaluate! Next semester I enrolled in all computer science classes and haven't looked back since!
