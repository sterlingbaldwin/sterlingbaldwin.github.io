      I attended Analy Highschool in Sebastopol. At the time I hated school with a passion, but there were a couple amazing teachers there who made it suck less. Shout out to Ms.Williamson who spent almost every single one of her weekends dealing with debate practice and getting students back and forth to tournaments. Much like a bad acid trip, many hours of debate can seriously alter how your brain interprets the world around you. My life was forever changed. After leaving the school in 2007, it took me a while to make it back into a classroom.

      After working at Redwood Hill Farms, I decided it was time for a major change in my life, and I enrolled in classes at the SRJC. At the time I was sure I wanted to get a degree in Mechanical Engineering. Even though I ended up changing my mind after a year of classes, it was still a very good experiance for me to go into something that I <em>thought</em> I was into, only to find that actually I hated it. As one of my professors told me, fail early fail often! Nothing is worse then investing years of your life into something only to find after all that time that you really cant stand it. After that first rocky year, I realized that I had been doing terribly in my material science class because I had spent 100 hours working on the tick-tack-toe game for my MATLAB course. One was a major requirement that I hated, the other an elective I couldnt get enough of. Time to re-evaluate! Next semester I enrolled in all computer science classes and haven't looked back since!
