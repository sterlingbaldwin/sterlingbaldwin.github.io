      Currently I am an intern working at the Lawrence Livermore National Labratory. I will be doing web developement for the <a href="http://aims.llnl.gov/">AIMS</a> climate data visualization project. Although I just started at LLNL, I already like the place and am starting to get more comfortable walking around the campus. A lot of my friends who have gone out to work as interns for large companies have told me stories of being stuck in a small room and given next to zero instruction, and no projects. This is very much not that! My mentor has been giving me a steady string of things to work on, and information to get me geared up to start writing code for the AIMS project. I'm excited to get up to speed and get my first accepted pull request!

      From July 2012 until June 2011 I worked at the IT contractor JC-Tech. Working there was my first professional experiance in the technical world, and although I had a wealth of knowledge from messing around on my own networks, had no formal training. The founder Joe Crossman interviewed me and highered me on the spot even with my lack of experiance. His training method was very much Training-by-Fire, and even though working there was probably one of the most stressful periods of my life, I learned more faster then ever before or since. If you're in the North bay and need computer repairs, I highly recommend them! While working there I wrote several articles for the website, one which <a href="http://jc-tech.net/archives/1002"> can be found here.</a>

      From the summer of 2008 until the end of the summer 2009 I worked as a quality control technician for the Redwood Hill Farms. There are a local cheese and yogurt producer from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastopol,_California">Sebastopol California</a> (my home town). Working for them was quite a bit of fun, I met a lot of cool people, learned how to curse better in spanish, and ate a <em>lot</em> of cheese. At the time, I worked under the head cheese maker Erika Sharfin. She left the company to start the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PennyRoyalFarm">Penny Royal Farms</a> up in Boonville. They make some seriously good cheese!
