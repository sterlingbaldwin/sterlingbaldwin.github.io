<p>After almost walking into someone on the sidewalk, I quickly learned that one of the unspoken rules of Irish life is passing people right shoulder to right shoulder,
just like they drive here. The second rule I learned is that if you want to catch the bus, you need to stand right up against the sidewalk. I was standing all of 2 feed back
from the edge, directly under the bus stop sign, but the driver just blew right past without a second thought. Its these little things that no on bothers to tell you, since obviously
everyone knows the rules already so why bother saying anything?</p>
